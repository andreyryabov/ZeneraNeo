// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The project's `.env`
//
// A project is a directory, and some of what it needs to run is particular to
// it: the token for the service it talks to, the base url of the environment
// it talks to it in. The keyring answers "what can this machine pay for"; this
// answers "what does this project need", and the two are different questions
// often enough to be worth two places.
//
// Precedence is the same one everything else here uses — the real environment
// always wins. What is already set in the shell is left alone, this file fills
// the gaps, and the keyring fills whatever is still missing after that. So a
// variable exported for one command still overrides the file, which is the
// behaviour anybody typing `FOO=bar zen run` is expecting.
//
// The names, not the values, are what leaves this module: they are what the
// sandbox forwards, and forwarding by name is what keeps a secret out of an
// argv. See `forwarded()` in sandbox.ts for the rest of that story.
