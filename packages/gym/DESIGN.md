# @zenera/gym - Design

Status: draft
Scope: `packages/gym`

## 1. What it is

A mock HTTP server for OpenAPI/Swagger documents, backed by a **stateful world**
that follows a **story** and draws on **reference documents**. Two agents do the
writing:

- the **handler agent** writes one TypeScript handler per operation: the API's
  _mechanics_ (which type, which filter, what a write changes, how it pages);
- the **world agent** writes the _content_ those handlers read: records that
  agree with the story, the docs, and everything already in the world.

The split is the whole design. A handler holds no content, so one cached handler
serves every story: change the story and the world changes, the code does not.

## 2. Inputs

```
zen gym serve [spec…] --schema <path>… --story <path>… --docs <path>… --world <name|file>
                 │            │                │                 │                │
                 ▼            ▼                ▼                 ▼                ▼
            inputs.ts    inputs.ts       knowledge.ts       knowledge.ts       store.ts
            expandSchemas: files,        story: read,       docs: indexed      worldPath
            dirs (only files that        quoted whole in    (rag), searched
            declare swagger/openapi),    every world-agent  by both agents
            quoted globs                 prompt
                 │
                 ├──▶ spec.ts     Operation[] (dereferenced, 2020-12)  → router, validate, probes
                 └──▶ catalog.ts  rag graph (bundled, named types)     → TS briefs, graph tools,
                                                                         record types, references
```

Nothing in the interface mentions indexes: the API graph is built in memory, and
the docs index lives under `<cache>/indexes/`, keyed by the docs' content and the
embedding model, if `--embedding` asked for one (by default there is none, and
the docs are searched by wording through the index's full-text half). `serve` and `build`
both index everything **before** anything else happens; `build` then writes
every handler and exits.

## 3. Threads

```
 main thread (the server process)                    worker thread
 ────────────────────────────────                    ─────────────
 server.ts    HTTP: route, check, answer
 cache.ts     which handler; builds, one at a time
 generate.ts  handler agent ─── model calls ─▶ LLM
 synth.ts     world agent   ─── model calls ─▶ LLM
 box.ts       talks to the worker ◀── messages ──▶  worker.ts + runtime.ts
                                                     imports handler.ts, runs handle(req, ctx)
                  │                                          │
                  └────────── world.sqlite (WAL) ────────────┘
                         both open the same file
```

Agents, the model and the keys stay on the main thread. The worker has an empty
environment and runs model-written code only; a handler stuck in a loop costs one
request and a worker restart.

## 5. One request

```

## 6. Writing a handler

```
cache.ensure(op) ── miss ──▶ lease build:<key> (machine-wide; another process waits, then reads)
                                 │
                                 ▼
  brief:  operation as TypeScript (catalog.describe)
          "this operation is about `Thing` records" (catalog.itemType: unwraps list envelopes)
          RELATED OPERATIONS, closest first: same record type, same resource,
              carriers traced through the graph, nearby paths — [built] marked
          WHERE TYPES LIVE: the bindings
          FROM THE REFERENCE DOCUMENTS: recalled passages about the operation
          THE WORLD SO FAR
  tools:  read_handler, list_operations, list_collections, read_collection,
          describe_types, trace_api, grep_api, list_api, find_types_with_property,
          search_docs, grep_docs, list_docs, read_docs, test_handler
                                 │ test_handler(source)
                                 ▼
          snapshot the world → scratch copy; run probes there (probe: true → fake.ts content)
          judge: runs? a body, not ctx.fail? response schema? echo rule? page walk?
          placement: every (collection, type, idField) the runs touched —
              untyped collection → refused; unknown type → refused;
              disagrees with a binding → refused; two ways in one handler → refused
                                 │
              pass ──────────────┴────────────── fail
       bind new types; keep the source        problems back to the agent;
       with the bindings it used              after --attempts: BuildFailed + report
```

## 7. Writing the world

```

   re-reads ctx.db ◀──── 'synthesized'│                          │
```

- `ctx.lookup(Type, id)` asks for exactly that id; `ctx.ensure(Type, …)` asks
  for a population. A collection that only holds what clients wrote is not
  _populated_ until its first read fills it as the story has it.
- `where` matches structurally: scalars as text, objects as subsets, a scalar
  against a list as membership.
- `ctx.owner()` is the `accounts` record `@me`, shaped by gym (no document
  declares it). Handlers resolve `me` / `primary` / `self` through it.

## 8. The worker

```
 host (box.ts)                                   worker (worker.ts)
 run ── { type: 'run', id, file, version,     ──▶ import(file?v=version)
          db, input, bindings }                    ctx = createContext(input, store,
 start timer (--timeout)                                   synthesize, bindings, record)

```

`runtime.ts` and `store.ts` load inside the worker, so they import only `node:`
built-ins and `randexp`, and use only erasable TypeScript.

## 9. Bindings

```
handler names a type ── ctx.lookup('Message', id) ──▶ resolve():
                                                        bound?   → binding's collection, idField
                                                        unbound? → collectionFor('Message') = 'messages'
                                                        lowercase name → a collection; its type
                                                                         from the bindings, if any
judge: placement(used) ──▶ conflicts? refused : new pairs bound on a pass
cache: stored { source, meta, bindings } ──▶ on a hit, any disagreement → miss (rebuilt);
                                              a cleared store is refilled from its handlers
world agent: save_records({ type }) ──▶ binds a type nobody has used yet
```

Bindings are add-only and live in the machine-wide cache (`gym-bindings`), keyed
by the documents' type names — the same documents share them from anywhere, like
their handlers.

## 10. Several processes

```
 zen gym serve mail.yaml --story w.md        zen gym serve calendar.yaml --story w.md
          │ :8787                                      │ :8788
          ▼                                            ▼
   <cache>/worlds/story-<digest(w.md)>.sqlite  ◀── same file ──▶  (or --world <name|file>)
       records(collection, id, data, updated_at)
       meta(key, value):  populated:<collection>:<where>
                          lease:fill:<collection>:<where|ids>     one world agent per fill
 ~/.zenera/neo/cache/gym-handler/leases.sqlite:
                          lease:build:<key>                       one handler build per key
 ~/.zenera/neo/cache/gym-bindings/…                               one set of bindings
```

A lease lapses when its time is up or its process is gone, so a crash never
costs anyone the whole lease.

## 11. On disk

```

## 12. Keys

```
handler   = sha256(CONTRACT_VERSION, method, path, operationId, parameters,
                   request and response schemas without annotations, paging)
            + the bindings it used, checked on every hit
bindings  = sha256(the documents' type names)
docs idx  = sha256(docs content) + embedding model
world     = --world <name|file>  |  sha256(story content)  |  default
not keyed : the model, the story and docs (for handlers), the file a spec came from
```

Nothing is ever invalidated: a changed input is a different key, and the old
artefact is simply never looked up again.

## 13. When things fail

| What failed                                      | Answer                        | Rebuilds the handler?              |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Request does not match the document              | 400 / 404 / 405               | no                                 |
| Two documents define the same route              | refuses to start, names both  | —                                  |
| Handler build never passed the judge             | 501 + build report link       | no (remembered for the process)    |
| Model unreachable while building                 | 500                           | no (retried on the next request)   |
| Handler threw, timed out, or answered off-schema | rebuilt with a repair brief   | yes, up to `--regen-limit` per URL |
| Handler chose `ctx.fail(status)`                 | that status and body          | no                                 |
| World agent failed inside a handler              | 502 `WORLD_AGENT_FAILED`      | no                                 |
| World agent made fewer than required             | sampled records fill in       | no                                 |
| A made record points at nothing                  | reported in the narration     | no                                 |
| Embedding the docs failed                        | docs searched by wording only | —                                  |
| Worker could not start                           | 503                           | no                                 |
| Client loops past the last page                  | token cut, items emptied      | no                                 |
