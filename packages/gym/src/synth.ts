// Handlers know where content lives; this is where it comes from. A handler
// that finds the world empty — no messages yet, no event with that id — asks
// for records, and an agent writes them: reading the story, reading what the
// world already holds so the same people keep the same addresses across APIs,
// and saving records that are checked against the schema before anything can
// read them. What it saves is permanent, so the second request sees the first
// request's world.
//
// Judging a handler asks for content too, and gets `fake.ts` instead: a probe
// is about mechanics, and an agent call per probe would make every build slow
// and every build cost.
