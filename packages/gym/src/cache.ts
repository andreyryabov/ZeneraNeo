// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The cache
//
// Two layers over one identity. `Operation.key` is a function of the
// operation's shape, so a spec edit produces a new key and the old artefact is
// simply never asked for again — there is nothing to invalidate, which is the
// part of a cache that is usually wrong.
//
// The handler itself lives in the machine's shared cache rather than beside
// the box's workspace, so the same spec served from two directories is
// written once. The box root is scratch: a hit is copied back into it, because
// the worker imports a file, not a string.
//
// The in-flight map is the other half and matters more than it looks: ten
// requests arriving together for an uncached operation must produce one build,
// not ten. A failed build is remembered too, for the same reason — an operation
// the model could not write for should not re-ask on every request.
