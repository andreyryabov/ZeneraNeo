// A project is a directory, so sharing one is a question about which of its
// files are the project and which are the machine it happened to run on. The
// answer is the same one `.gitignore` gives — sessions, scratch and the `.env`
// are local; `agents.yaml`, the spec, the assets and what the agents learned
// are the project — with one difference that matters: the vectors travel. A
// clone rebuilds a rag index from the documents it carries, but nothing
// rebuilds memory from its graph, and an archive is not a clone with a setup
// step waiting for it. It is the whole thing, or it is not worth sending.
//
// The format is a zip because every machine already opens one, and because a
// person who is handed an archive should be able to look inside it without
// this tool. There is one file at the root that this tool wrote — the manifest
// — and one directory beside it holding the project verbatim. Nothing else.
//
// Everything here is streaming. An assets tree with vectors in it runs to
// hundreds of megabytes, and a reader that has to hold the archive in memory
// to open it is a reader that fails on the archives worth sending.
