// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The drawing surface
//
// This is the CLI's one dependency, and it is behind a dynamic import in the
// `run` command: nothing else in the tool loads React, so `zen list` and
// `zen key ls` stay as fast as they would be without it.
//
// It is a *view*. Every turn goes through `Engine.run`, exactly as the one-shot
// path does, so a session started here is indistinguishable from one started in
// a script — nothing is recorded only when someone is watching.
//
// The shape of a turn on screen is the shape of the agent loop, in the order it
// happened: what the model said, then the calls that decision led to, then what
// it said next. Everything before the answer is history the moment it lands, so
// it goes into the scrollback and stays there; only what is still in flight
// repaints, at the bottom, above the footer. The earlier layout put the
// streaming answer *below* calls that had already finished, which read as two
// unrelated logs racing each other.
//
// Reasoning is the exception: it is drawn live, above the work it decided on,
// and replaced when the next model call opens. It never reaches the scrollback
// — a summary of how the model got somewhere is worth watching and is not worth
// re-reading, and the full chain is in the trajectory and the run's report.

// The repainting frame
//
// Everything below `Static` is redrawn on every event, and it has one hard
// constraint: **it must never be taller than the terminal.** Ink erases the
// previous frame by moving the cursor up over it, which only works while that
// frame is still on screen. A frame that outgrows the viewport scrolls its own
// top away, the erase falls short, and every repaint strands another copy of
// its first line in the scrollback — the same line, over and over, with the
// text creeping sideways as the stream advances.
//
// The unit that matters here is the **row the terminal draws**, not the line
// the model wrote. A reasoning stream is one enormous paragraph with almost no
// newlines in it, so counting `\n` says "six lines" while the terminal draws
// sixty. So `windowOf` wraps the text itself, to a width it knows, and takes
// the last N wrapped rows — and then the same number is given again as an
// explicit `height` with `overflow="hidden"`, so a miscount clips instead of
// corrupting.
//
// Nothing is lost by any of it: the finished answer lands in `Static` whole,
// and the full reasoning chain is in the trajectory and the run's report.
//
// How the rows are divided between the three blocks is `budgetOf` in wrap.ts.
