// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The project check
//
// The loader already validates everything here — and stops at the first thing
// it does not like, with the offending key named. That is exactly right for a
// run: nothing should start on a project that will not hold together.
//
// It is exactly wrong for someone *fixing* the project. A first error is a
// keyhole: fix it, run again, find the next one, six times. So this walks the
// same ground and refuses to stop, collecting every finding it can reach, and
// says what it found rather than throwing it.
//
// Two consequences shape the whole module. Nothing here throws for a problem
// *in the project* — a throw would end the walk and cost the findings after it
// — so every check that could throw is wrapped and turned into a `Finding`.
// And nothing here *needs* a credential or a network: a check that only works
// on a machine already set up is no use to the machine that is not.
//
// Two steps are the exception, and both are deliberate. A Dockerfile that does
// not build is a broken project, and nothing short of building it says so — the
// file parses, the path exists, and the failure waits for the first run. So the
// check builds it and runs one command in it, against a temporary directory
// rather than anyone's workspace, and takes the container down again on the way
// out. For the same reason it asks each model it can pay for to answer once: a
// credential that authenticates says nothing about the model id it is spent on,
// so a misspelt or retired id is invisible to every reading of the files.
// `--no-sandbox` and `--no-models` turn them off. A missing container engine, or
// a provider that never answered, stays a warning — the machine that is not set
// up yet is still owed the rest.
