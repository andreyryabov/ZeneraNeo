/**
 * Many questions, one project, at once.
 *
 * The shape of the thing follows from two facts about a run. A workspace is a
 * directory the agent writes into, so two runs cannot share one; and a memory
 * takes a lock on its directory, so two runs cannot share that either. A batch
 * is therefore not "`zen run` in a loop with a semaphore" — it is a set of
 * isolated runs that happen to have been asked together, and the batch
 * directory is where that isolation is kept.
 *
 * The one thing they *can* share is a memory nobody writes to. That is what
 * `--memory-read-only` is for, and why it had to become real in the runtime
 * before this command could exist: recall used to commit a `lastUsedAt` bump,
 * which is a write, which is a lock, which is a batch of one.
 *
 * Everything that can be refused is refused before the first model call. A
 * batch is the case where a mistake is paid for a hundred times.
