# The one command that initialises this project.
#
#   scripts/_setup.sh            do whatever is not done yet
#   scripts/_setup.sh --force    do all of it again
#   scripts/_setup.sh --check    say what is not done, and do none of it
#
# Anything that has to be in place before a run — an index built, a document
# fetched, a file generated — is a script in this directory rather than a
# paragraph somebody is meant to follow. The leading underscore is what
# separates the runner from the steps it runs.
#
# Each step is `scripts/<name>.sh`, named below in the order they depend on
# each other. A step:
#
#   - starts `set -eu` and `cd "$(dirname "$0")/.."`, so it works from anywhere
#   - takes no arguments, and reads $FORCE to know whether to redo finished work
#   - exits 0 when it did the work, 3 when there was nothing to do, non-zero
#     when it failed
#   - under $CHECK, does none of the work: it runs the same "already done" test,
#     exits 3 when the answer is yes, and otherwise says what is missing and
#     exits 4. A check must not assume an earlier step has run — a missing
#     prerequisite is a 4 of its own, not a hard failure, or one unbuilt thing
#     hides the rest of the list
#   - writes under .tmp/ and moves the result into place, so an interrupted run
#     never leaves half an artefact behind
#
# A step decides it has nothing to do by testing for something that SURVIVES A
# CLONE. Files that are git-ignored do not: a vector index commits its manifest
# and ignores `lance/`, so `[ -f .../manifest.json ]` is true on a fresh
# checkout that cannot search at all, and every step reports `skipped` until the
# first search fails for a reason nobody connects to setup. Ask the tool instead
# of guessing at files — `zen rag docs ready` answers exactly that question.
#
# That test is the whole of `--check`, which is why this is one script and not
# two: the steps already know what "done" means, and a second script asking the
# same question would be a second answer to keep in step with this one.
#
# Running this twice has to be safe, and the second run is what proves it: every
# step should report `skipped`.
