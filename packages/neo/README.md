# @zenera/core

**A multi-agent runtime for Node.js: agents, models, tools, skills, memory and
an append-only trajectory.**

> Part of [ZeneraNeo](https://github.com/andreyryabov/ZeneraNeo). This is an
> open-source side project for experimentation and chore work — **not** the
> official Zenera AI Platform. It carries no support or stability promises.

## Install

Node.js 24+, ESM only. Runtime dependencies are `yaml` and `zod` and nothing
else; the four vendor SDKs are **optional peer dependencies**, not loaded until
a client for that vendor is first built, so an OpenAI-only application never
pays for the others.

```sh
npm i @zenera/core openai
npm i @zenera/core @anthropic-ai/sdk
npm i @zenera/core @google/genai
npm i @zenera/core @openrouter/sdk
```

## Use

There are two ways in, and they meet in the middle: declare the agents in code,
or load them from a folder.

### In code

An agent is an instruction, a model, some tools, and who it may hand work to.
That is the whole list — there is no orchestration layer underneath.

```ts
import { AgentRunner, createModel, tool } from '@zenera/core';

const getWeather = tool<{ city: string }>({
    name: 'get_weather',
    description: 'Current weather for a city.',
    parameters: {
        type: 'object',
        properties: { city: { type: 'string' } },
        required: ['city'],
        additionalProperties: false,
    },
    execute: ({ city }) => ({ city, tempC: 21, sky: 'clear' }),
});

const runner = new AgentRunner({ model: createModel('openai:gpt-5.4-mini') });

const planner = runner.agent({
    name: 'planner',
    description: 'Turns a request into a concrete day-by-day plan.',
    instructions: 'Answer with a plan. Check the weather before you commit to a day.',
    tools: [getWeather],
});

const result = await runner.run(planner, 'Two days in Rome, outdoors where possible.');
console.log(result.output);
```

`run()` returns a handle: `await` it for the answer, or iterate it for the
stream — token deltas plus a checkpoint for every model call, tool call,
handoff, fork and join.

```ts
for await (const ev of runner.run(planner, 'Two days in Rome.')) {
    if (ev.type === 'text_delta') process.stdout.write(ev.delta);
}
```

A second agent and a handoff is one more `runner.agent({ … })` plus
`handoffs: [planner]` on the first. Skills, memory scopes and payload stores are
declared once on the runner and referenced by id from each agent allowed to use
them.

### From a folder

An agentic project is a folder — prompts, agent wiring, skills and tool
selections are Markdown and YAML files, not code buried inside an application.
Load one and run it:

```ts
import { loadProject } from '@zenera/core';

const project = await loadProject('./my-project', { tools: [lookupPolicy] });

for await (const ev of project.run('Water damage, policy NM-448127.')) {
    // stream events: thinking, text, tool calls, handoffs, usage
}
```

The whole system is an `agents.yaml`:

```yaml
default: intake
model: anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-5
skills: agents/skills

agents:
    - name: intake
      description: Takes the first message and routes the case.
      system: agents/prompts/intake.md
      tools: [policy_lookup]
      handoffs: [adjuster]

    - name: adjuster
      description: Weighs the written policy against the case and explains the outcome.
      system: agents/prompts/adjuster.md
      model: openai:gpt-5.4
      tools: [workspace:*, sandbox:*]
      skills:
          discovery: index # the model loads what the case needs
          preload: [house_style] # always on, from turn one
```

It is validated strictly at load: an unknown tool, a handoff to nobody, a
missing prompt file — each fails immediately, naming the offending key, instead
of surfacing three turns into a run as a confused model.

## What it gives you

- **Agents** — an instruction, a model, tools, skills, plus handoffs and fork.
  There is no hidden orchestration layer.
- **Models** — OpenAI, Anthropic, Google/Vertex and OpenRouter behind one
  interface, each through its own SDK, plus any OpenAI-compatible endpoint.
  Named providers and model aliases resolve from config or from the host.
- **Tools** — plain typed functions, selectable per agent by name, group or
  wildcard. Workspace file tools and a Podman sandbox ship with the library.
- **Skills** — instruction bundles discovered and loaded on demand instead of
  permanently occupying the prompt, optionally owning their own tools.
- **Memory** — pluggable `MemoryStore`s, with scopes deciding what is private to
  an agent and what is shared.
- **Trajectory** — an append-only log of everything that happened. Provider
  messages are a projection of it, and compaction _covers_ nodes rather than
  deleting them, so the audit trail survives context pressure.
- **Inspection** — `renderReportHtml` turns any run into one self-contained HTML
  file: the graph, every request, every token.

`@zenera/rag` also exports tools you can hand straight to `loadProject`, so an
agent can search an API it has never read.
