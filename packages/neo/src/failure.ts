// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// What the runtime was doing when a provider refused
//
// A vendor error says what was wrong with the request and nothing at all about
// which request it was. Google throws with its whole response body as the
// message, and that body carries another JSON document inside its own
// `message`, so what reaches a person is:
//
//   {"error":{"message":"{\n \"error\": {\n \"code\": 400, …","code":400,…}}
//
// A turn generates, streams and embeds against several models, and that
// sentence names none of them — which of the calls failed, on which
// connection, and against which model id are all missing.
//
// So every SDK call runs through `called()` (and every stream body through
// `reading()`), which re-throws a `ProviderError` carrying the half of the
// sentence the vendor left out and keeps the original as `cause`. The status is
// copied onto the wrapper because everything that classifies a failure — the
// embedding limiter here, the CLI's liveness probe — reads it off the error it
// was handed.
//
// Retries
//
// A failure that reaches here has already been retried: each client is built
// with a retry budget (see `models/factory.ts`), and those retries are inside
// the one call `called()` made. So the report is the elapsed time rather than a
// count — a connection refused in 200ms and one that spent 40s failing four
// times are different problems, and only the clock tells them apart.
//
// The exception is the response body. Every SDK's backoff wraps the request,
// and a stream is opened by a request that succeeded, so a connection reset
// while the answer is arriving is retried by nobody. `reading()` retries that
// itself, but only while the stream has emitted nothing: once a delta has been
// handed to the caller it is on screen, and a second stream would repeat it.
// That is why a failure names the chunks it had already delivered.
