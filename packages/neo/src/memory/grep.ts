// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// The memory, read exhaustively
//
// `search` ranks and `grep` decides. They answer different questions and
// neither can be made to answer the other's: a ranking hands back the top of a
// list, so "nothing came back" and "nothing is there" are the same result, and
// the one question memory keeps raising — *did we already write this down* —
// needs them to be different results. So this is one pass, no embedder, no
// credential, and `found` is the true total even when the list was cut.
//
// Three fields, because a memory is not only its summary. `text` is what the
// ranker sees; `metadata` is where an agent puts the identifiers nobody would
// ever phrase as a sentence — a commit sha, an endpoint, a container name; and
// the bytes of a remembered file are the thing itself. An exact match belongs
// against all three.
//
// Two rules keep this honest against raw `grep` over /memory, which is what it
// exists to replace. Superseded nodes are excluded unless asked for, and come
// back flagged when they are — serving a withdrawn correction as current is
// the failure mode the mount is warned about. And reading here is not use:
// recency decay is meant to track what an agent actually opened, and a finder
// that bumped it would make every scan look like a read.
