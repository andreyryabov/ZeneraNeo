// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// Memory — knowledge that outlives a run (the trajectory is one run's record)
//
// A graph, not a list of records. The reason is the shape of what is worth
// remembering: a script an agent wrote is useless without the request that
// asked for it, the plan that shaped it and the endpoint it calls, and those
// four things are one memory even though they are four pieces of text. A store
// that can only return a ranked list of rows leaves the joining to the model,
// every single time.
//
// Every node is timed. `createdAt` is provenance, but `lastUsedAt` is what
// ranking actually leans on: memory that keeps proving useful should surface
// ahead of memory that was written once and never read, and neither an
// embedding nor an edge can tell you that.
//
// Visibility is per node, by label, denied by default. One graph serves every
// agent in a project; `audience` decides which of them may see a node at all.
// A second user is a second graph, not a second label: `audience` is about
// which agent may read a node, never about whose memory it is.

/**
 * The built-in vocabulary. A kind earns its place only when ranking, rendering
 * or loading branches on it — anything else is free text wearing an enum
 * costume, and it costs the model accuracy when it has to choose one.
 *
 * A project may declare its own set (`memory.kinds` in the config), which
 * *replaces* this one; the tool schema is built from the result, so the
 * provider constrains decoding to labels that actually exist.
 *
 * `preference` is the exception, and `MemoryIndex` re-adds it to whatever a
 * project declares: the engine itself reads that kind to build the system
 * prompt, so a project able to define it away would silently lose the feature
 * rather than opt out of it.
